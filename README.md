# PBF
A P Bass sound font in SFZ format

This is a sound font created from samples of a P style electric bass.

To use, download the zip and extract the PBF Sub Folder that contains the .wav fles and the .sfz file, 
then load the PBF.sfz file into your synthesizer.

This was tested with the liquidsfz synthesizer plugin.
